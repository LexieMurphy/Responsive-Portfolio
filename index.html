      <p id="division">Hello my name is Lexie Murphy and welcome to my Portfolio!
      </p>

      <p id="division">I am a Construction Manager by degree, an Engineering Design Technology manager by trade, and a web developer at heart! I graduated from the University of Central Missiouri with a BS in Construction Management and a minor in Business Administration. While attending school, I also lettered in athletics through women's soccer as a Jennie. College is also where I was lucky enough to meet my incredible husband, Colin. We said our "I-do's" back in 2013 and now have two kiddos we've added to the mix. Malachi (Kai) turned 3 in August, and Evangeline (Evie) just turned one at the end of October. I am one blessed and lucky lady. 
      </p>

      <p id="division">I am currently employed at Kiewit Power in Lenexa, KS and get to work each day as a part of a design technology team that supports our construction and engineering project's sites to (upon completion of construction) provide power to your homes - Pretty cool eh? I manage two groups within the department, the SharePoint Developers and the Web Developers. Both groups get to tackle very unique challenges and design/develop business solutions on a daily basis. I am very excited that moving forward, I can begin to dive deeper into the web development side and provide support as opportunities arise.
